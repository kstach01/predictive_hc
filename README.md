# Predictive Maps Code.

Code for generating simulations from Stachenfeld, Botvinick, & Gershman (2017).

## Getting started.

To get started, you can open this colab:
[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YT3DXfVUsEU46efCY4xRiqKNDa3DPsWY?usp=sharing
](url)

The colab is self-contained, with code in the collapsable cells, and should not require installation of any additional packages. The colab is read-only: to make your own edits, make a copy.

You can also download it as a jupyter notebook by cloning this repo.
